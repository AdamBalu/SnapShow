### Why SnapShow? 🥁

Have you ever been annoyed about not being able to filter out everything other than events/parties/concerts from your social media platform feed?

This app solves this issue by welcoming musical enthusiasts and letting them share their memories with each other. 

### How to use? 🎸
---
It's easy, just fire up the website, register your new account and pick your favorite event. And after you attend it, feel free to share! You can add friends and see their posts as well.
